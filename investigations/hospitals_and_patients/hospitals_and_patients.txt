Are average scores for hospital quality or procedural variability correlated with patient survey responses?

In order to assess this question, I found the correlation between a hospital's composite effectiveness measure and its patient survey ratings.
I found a modest positive correlation (r = .390) between achievement and quality of care.
Furthermore, the correlation between improvement and quality of care has a small, positive relationship at r = 220.
These findings support the methodology I used to create my composite score.
